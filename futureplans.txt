This will be a 2D game with a relatively basic story. Sprites will be gathered from an asset library.

The game must have: 
(3 basic enemies, 1 boss, 1 puzzle) --OOP
(Utilization of a database to save score)
(Multiple skills for user to use)
(Ability to summon characters for special attacks)
(Provide a guide character through out the game)

If it's free you can use it. The goal is to build a pretty nice 2D game by spending nothing.
